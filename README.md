# Reddit Scraper

## Purpose
Originally put up for investigative goals in an undergraduate thesis research project, this scraper allows to find posts within subreddits based on a particular search keyword and consequently download them in a csv file for further semantic or otherwise analysis.

## Instructions
There is not much needed to be done for the script to work.
Generally, any version of Python beyond 3.0 should do, can be downloaded from official website for free (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
The only things to pay attention to are the parameters of the search that you want to conduct.

As indicated on the screenshot, you would need to change the **query** to your desired search word, **after** and **before** parameters to the date stamps of interest, and **sub** parameters to clarify which subreddit is being searched.
Additionally, make sure to type in the name of the desired file at the end of the scraping process, when prompted by the terminal (the program will say "input filename of submission file, please add .csv" at that time).

Congratulations, you got yourself a load of reddit data to look at!
